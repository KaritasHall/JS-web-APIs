# JS-web-APIs
Welcome to my little platformer game! The goal is to collect as many stars you can, earning points, before the evil skulls get you. Each time the player
clears the board, more stars are released but also more enemies - making the game progressively harder each round.

The game is written using Javascript with Phaser API. There is a restart button that pops up when the player dies, inviting them
to try again - that is pretty much it for html. In CSS that button gets styled and I also used CSS to make Canvas fullscreen (Phaser uses
Canvas to "draw" the game).

There is an excellent tutorial on the Phaser website that takes you through the basic structure of a simple platformer game. I used that
to get me started and then messed around with the code to add more stuff and tweak things to my liking.

I outsourced all of the assets. There are a lot of amazing artists out there that share their work for free, so people like me who don't
know how to draw can make nice looking games. Most of them I edited in paint.net to adjust for size and to make the sprite sheets
usable. I made a sprite sheet myself from for the star to give it a hover animation. This was more challenging then the Javascript, honestly!

The skull is AI generated by Dall-e. I was messing around on Dall-e and thought it looked cool :)
